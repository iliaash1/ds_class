How does the time of day affect an order?
 
Using the instacart data I will examine how the time of day affects orders.  
Is there a correlation between customers who order during a specific time of day and the days from the last order?
Are there correlations between the types of items ordered and the time of day?  What types of items are ordered the most during different times of the day?
Is there a correlation between the number of times an item is reordered and the time of day?
Using the orders data within the instacart file downloaded I will filter out those orders that are used for testing and for training, leaving only those within the prior orders datasets.
After filtering the dataset I will join the orders csv to the order products prior csv on the order id.  From there I can see how often the product was ordered, and during what time of day.  Then using the products csv joining the order products prior csv on the product id I can see specifically what was ordered and during the time of day.  Also looking at the orders csv I'll take a look at the user id and the time of day the customer placed the order, along with the how many days since the customers last order.  Seeing if there is a correlation between those customers who place orders in the evening and number of days from their last order.
